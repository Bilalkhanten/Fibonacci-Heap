# Fibonacci-Heap
The implementation of Fibonacci heap is based on the algorithm described on CLRS while the adjacency list representation is  based on the one suggested by Guido van Rossum where hash table is used to associate each vertex in a graph with an array of  adjacent vertices. There is no explicit representation of edges as objects..
